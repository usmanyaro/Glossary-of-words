Gossary of words

* Seismic discontinuity- surface within the Earth at which the seimic wave velocities change.

* Moho- Seismic boundary between the crust and the mantle

* Potential Temperature- The tempereature a percel of mantle would have if it rose to the surface along an adiabatic gradient without melting

* Mantle temperature- Temperature of a mantle material at a particular depth

* Geotherm- temperature as a function of depth in the Earth

* Adiabatic gradient- The temperature gradient due to isentropic decompression, generally characterised by a potential temperature

* Thermal boundary layers- Temperature gradient in a region between non-mixing layers-the lithosphere, transition zone, and core-mantle boundary are examples

* mantle adiabatic temperature gradient- A temperature gradient resulting from change in volume via compression or decompression, but no change in heat (i.e. no conductive heat transfer)

* The Solidus- This is the temperature at which mantle rocks begin to melt

* Seismic tomography- A technique that provides a 3-D image of the crust and uppermost mantle- local tomography studies mainly provides information about the upper and middle crust- regional studies have better resolution within the uppermost mantle

* Receiver function technique- The method is highly effective at determining seismic discontinuities in the crust and uppermost mantle

* Lithosphere- The lithosphere is the rigid outer layer of the Earth. It differs from the underlying asthenosphere interms of its mechanical (or rheological i.e. flow) properties rather than its chemical composition
